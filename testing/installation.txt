Please first go to "https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" and download the appropriate 3.8 installer.

Then run the installer to get access to Python 3.8 and the conda package manager.

Open Anaconda Prompt.
Navigate to the folder called MangaNewChapter-main.
Use pip install -r requirements.txt to get all the necessary packages found within.

Type in ipython to open your interactive shell, run the line "import checker" and then use "checker.a()", "checker.n()", or "checker.s()" depending on what you'd like to do.
a() shows all the manga on the list, n() shows only the ones with new chapters, and s() saves all to a .txt file.
For editing the .txt files in a safe way, run checker.primer() as a new user that wants to choose which manga of the base
list to keep, checker.add() to add however many new manga to your list, and checker.change_current() to update which chapter
you are on for every manga currently on your list. Throughout, pressing enter for input will cancel the action you've taken.
Alternatively, customize the mangas list within list.txt and the latest chapters you've read within latest.txt while
keeping in mind proper formatting (look to the original setup for guidance). This alternative is not recommended.

Enjoy!

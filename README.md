# MangaNewChapter
Stop clicking through endless links to see if there is a new chapter available. This Python script lets you list all your favorite mangas and then checks each one's latest chapter against your most recently read chapter. Currently supports web comics from Mangelo, ReadMng, Zero and Leviatan Scans, Manga Effect, Mankakalot, MangaDex, LHTranslation, and Asura Scans.

When <a href="#su">setting up for yourself</a>, follow the linked 4 steps.

The current recommended use is to open AnacondaPrompt, create an iPython shell, import the file , and use either the a() function to see all the manga on your list, the n() function to only see manga with new chapters, or the s() function to save results to a .txt file.

# Codes

### Status - The main difference between the three lies with automatic aligning of your latest chapter read with the latest released for utd. The other two depend upon Change Current.
<ul>
  <li>utd = up to date</li>
  <li>wip = work in progess</li>
  <li>yts = yet to start</li>
</ul>

### Source - There is a select list of supported manga sites that is continuously growing. Names are case-sensitive.

### Tier - My personal rankings of the "starter pack" manga as seen in tier.txt. Intended to help selective new readers choose only the best. Found as (#) in manga names.
<ol>
  <li>The Top Tier reserved for my favorites.</li>
  <li>The Middle Tier for all the manga I really liked.</li>
  <li>The Bottom Tier holds manga that I liked some parts and not others. </li>
 </ol>
 Note: I read and enjoyed all manga within the initial list.txt file so don't take this to mean Tier 2 or 3 are low quality.
 
### Categories - My personal categories for the "starter pack" manga as seen in categories.txt. Intended to help readers identify preferences. Found as \[Abcd\] in manga names.
<ol>
  <li>System Leveling - Worlds where there exists a system of some sort that allows "players" or "hunters" to level up and become physically stronger.</li>
  <li>Culivator Reincarnation - The main character reincarnated and uses his knowledge to cultivate faster. More fantastical/magical than below.</li>
  <li>Martial Reincarnation - The main character reincarnated and uses his knowledge to train faster. More realistic than above.</li>
  <li>Plot Heavy - Stories where the action takes a backseat to adventure and character development.</li>
  <li>Underdog Cultivator - Someone, typically the weakest character, miraculously acquires an artifact or method to rise up and become the strongest.</li>
  <li>Virtual Reality Game - Worlds where there exists a very popular VR game that the main character enters and becomes famous within.</li>
 </ol>
 Note: Order of categories does not mark my preferences.

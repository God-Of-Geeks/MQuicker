Please first go to "https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" and download the appropriate 3.8 installer.

Then run the installer to get access to Python 3.8 and the conda package manager.

Open Anaconda Prompt.
Navigate to the folder called MangaNewChapter-main.
Use the commands in the package_downloads.cmd file to get all the necessary packages by running them one-by-one.

Type in ipython to open your interactive shell, run the line "import checker" and then use "checker.a()", "checker.n()", or "checker.s()" depending on what you'd like to do.
Customize the mangas list within checker.py and the latest chapters you've read in the same order you placed them in the mangas list within latest.txt.
Enjoy!
